## RPM Data Collection
We have successfully implemented RPM data collection using a proximity sensor. This allows us to monitor the engine's rotational speed, which is crucial for optimizing performance and efficiency.

## CAN Module Integration
Our team has studied and integrated the Controller Area Network (CAN) module of the Motor Controller. This enables us to communicate with various vehicle components over the CAN bus, facilitating real-time data exchange and control.

## Battery Management System (BMS)
We have worked on building a Thermistor Module for the BMS. This module provides temperature monitoring and control for the vehicle's batteries, ensuring their safety and longevity.

## 9-Axis Accelerometer Study
Our project includes a comprehensive study of a 9-axis accelerometer, enabling us to analyze two-dimensional instantaneous acceleration. This data is valuable for understanding vehicle dynamics and driver behavior.

## Thermistor Module for BMS
We have designed and implemented a thermistor module for the Battery Management System (BMS). This module helps us monitor and control the temperature of the batteries, ensuring they operate within safe limits.

## Hardware Transition
Our journey involved transitioning from Arduino to ESP32 and eventually to Raspberry Pi for data acquisition and processing. This progression has allowed us to scale our system and incorporate advanced features.

## Data Logging to Google Sheets
We have developed web scripts that enable us to fetch vehicle data and log it into Google Sheets. This feature provides remote access to real-time and historical data, enhancing our ability to analyze and track vehicle performance.
